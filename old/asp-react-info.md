all of the asp + react templates have:

an api with endpoints

that u can use in ur react client

but u have to do this
u cant just call c# functions in react

of course


so

the blazor server is the alternative
or razor pages
obviously this can call c#


blazor replaces react anyway so u wouldnt use both

nextjs cant either huh
have to use api endpoints

angular asp same
it is still api endpoint



api server all lang!


portfolio idea

wasm imgui + vid background
